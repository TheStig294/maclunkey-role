![Maclunkey.png](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1701785879208140002/20F8B137BB543CE82A9039CD9A9F5E2D8B702945/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false)

The Maclunkey is a member of the traitor team that pretends to be a jester!\
\
Initially, they act as a jester (can't deal damage, pink outline, immune to explosions, etc.), except they can be freely killed.\
\
However, once they shoot their "Maclunkey Gun", they lose all their jester-ness and become a proper traitor! (can deal damage, red outline to fellow traitors, not immune to explosions, etc.)\
When the Maclunkey Gun is drawn, it makes a "Maclunkey!" sound, so everyone near you is alerted!\
The Maclunkey doesn't receive the traitor items they buy until after their Maclunkey Gun is shot.

## You must enable the role for it to spawn!
If hosting a game from the main menu, put **ttt_maclunkey_enabled 1** in your listenserver.cfg.\
(Normally at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\cfg)\
\
If hosting a game from a dedicated server, put **ttt_maclunkey_enabled 1** in your server.cfg.

## Credits
Credit goes to [faaafv](https://steamcommunity.com/id/faaafv) for originally making the Maclunkey Gun, which I cleaned up and edited for this role.\
And of course a huge thank you to [Noxx](https://github.com/NoxxFlame) and [Malivil](https://github.com/Malivil) for making Custom Roles itself, and external roles possible!
